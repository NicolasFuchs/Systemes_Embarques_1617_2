 * Abstract: Introduction the C programming language
 *
 * Purpose: Simple C program implementing basic access to the GPIO modules
 *          of the AM3358 microprocessor to control the wheel and the
 *          7-segment display of the HEIA-FR extension card of the
 *          Beaglebone Black board
